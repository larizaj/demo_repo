Before diving into the details, I want to stress that a key factor for useful commit 
messages is consistency across collaborators in a repository. In my opinion, it is much 
more important that commit messages have the same semantics and look the same than 
they are objectively written optimally. It is powerful to be able to skim a list of commits 
and be able to get a feeling of the life that is going on in the repository. Some also add 
integrations to their IDEs that decorate each code line with the commit message subject 
of the commit that most recently changed that code line. This way of working is much 
more powerful if commit messages have the same basic shape. The Git feature we 
are using for this is not very sensitively called git blame. It allows us to point fingers at 
whoever caused a particular change. While this is useful, the connotations on the word 
blame are not very constructive or conducive of a healthy culture. We will cover git 
blame at a later point.
